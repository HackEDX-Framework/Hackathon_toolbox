We’re excited to have you join our hackathon! To save time, we recommend installing the essential tools and software on your laptop beforehand.

## Install Python

As programming language we use Python - just like in GPT.

We recommend using at least Python version 3.10 or higher.

<details>
    <summary>Windows</summary>

    On Windows 11 and 10 we recommend using the Microsoft Store version of Python.

    [Click here to get Python 3.13 from the Microsoft Store.](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PNRBTZXMB4Z)

    Click on Download and run the downloaded file. The setup  will do the work for you.

    After the setup, a Command Prompt window should open automatically, showing you Python and the respective installed version.

    </div>

</details> 

<details>
    <summary>MacOS</summary>

    1. [Click here to download the Python installer for macOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.1/python-3.13.1-macos11.pkg). It's a universal installer for both Intel and ARM based MacBooks. Click through the pages and accept the terms of the software license agreement.
    2. After the installation, a new Finder window opens with some files, but you can close it.
    3. To verify the installation of Python, open the `Terminal` through the Spotlight search (`command` + `space`).
    4. Type in the command `python3 --version` and press enter. The output should show the installed Python version.

## Install Pygame and NumPy

Python is successfully installed on our machine — great job! But to create games in Python, we’ll need a few additional libraries to make our work easier. Let’s install some extensions to enhance Python’s capabilities.

For this we use the integrated package manager of Python called `pip`.

<details>
    <summary> Windows </summary>

    1. Open the Windows Search and search for `cmd`. Open the result named `Command Prompt` or `Eingabeaufforderung` in german.
    2. Now we will install Pygame using pip. In the command prompt type the following command: `pip install pygame`. Press enter to run the command.
    3. After the installation completed, you can check if Pygame was successfully installed by running the integrated test game with the following command: `python -m pygame.examples.aliens`.
    4. Now let's install the other library we need, called numpy. Run the following command: `pip install numpy`.

    <div style={{ width :'98%', maxWidth: '500px',  margin: "auto" }}>
        <img src="/hack-participant-kit/Installing_Pygame_WindowsInstallationTest.png" alt="Installing Pygame on Windows - Installation Test"  />
    </div>

</details>

<details>
    <summary> MacOS </summary>

    1. Open the Spotlight search with `command` + `spacebar`.
    2. Now we will install Pygame using pip. In the Terminal type the following command: `pip3 install pygame`. Press enter to run the command.
    3. After the installation completed, you can check if Pygame was successfully installed by running the integrated test game: `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens`.
    4. Now let's install the other library we need, called NumPy. Run the following command: `pip3 install numpy`.

    <div style={{ width :'98%', maxWidth: '500px',  margin: "auto" }}>

    </div>

## Install Git

We use Git for version control, which makes it easy to download, manage and organize existing code. It also facilitates collaboration with other contributors by providing a good way to share code changes.

<details>
    <summary> Windows </summary>

    <div style={{ width :'98%', maxWidth: '500px',  margin: "auto" }}>
        <img src="/hack-participant-kit/Installing_Git_WindowsSetup.png" alt="Installing Git on Windows - Setup"  />
    </div>

    1. [Click here to access the official website from Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Click on `64-bit Git for Windows Setup` to download version of Git.
    2. Run the downloaded setup.
    3. The setup contains multiple pages with many options. The default settings are a good choice. This is why it's okay to just press next until the installation starts.
    4. To verify the installation, open `cmd` and run the command `git version`.

</details>

<details>
    <summary> MacOS </summary>
    <div style={{ width :'98%', maxWidth: '500px',  margin: "auto" }}>
        <img src="/hack-participant-kit/Installing_Git_MacOSXcodeSelect.png" alt="Installing Git on MacOS"  />
    </div>

    1. Open the Terminal.
    2. Type in the following command: `sudo xcode-select --install`.
    3. A dialog will appear, that says that the xcode-select command requires the command line developer tools. Click on `Install` to install them.
    4. To verify the installation, open `Terminal` and run the command `git version`.

</details>

## Install Pycharm

Now we need an environment to write Python code. While there are many options available — some of you might even use Notepad — we strongly recommend using PyCharm. It offers a variety of convenient features and, most importantly, supports Git integration, making version control usable.

    <div style={{ width :'98%', maxWidth: '500px',  margin: "auto" }}>
        <LightImage src="/hack-participant-kit/Installing_Pycharm_Ui.png" alt="Installing PyCharm UI"  />
    </div>

[Click here to open the download page for PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/download/).

1. Choose your platform (Windows, macOS or Linux).
2. Scroll down to PyCharm Community Edition and download this one. It's free.
