# Best practices for Coding
<ActivityTracker/>

## What are best coding practices?

There a set of informal rules for programming, to improve the **quality of the code**.

## Readability

**Everyone should understand your code easily**.

`Example:`

```python
def how_to_calculate_percentage (price, tax_rate):
  return price * (tax_rate / 100)
```

### Naming

Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

#### BAD: Vague names that don’t convey purpose

```python
# bad: vague names that don’t convey purpose
def c(x, y):
    return x * y

# good: descriptive names that clarify intent
def calculate_area(width, height):
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle."""
    return width * height
```

### Spacing

Use proper spacing to make code more readable.

```python
# bad: no spacing, hard to read
def multiply(a,b):return a*b

# good: Consistent spacing between elements and around operators
def multiply(a, b):
    """Multiplies two numbers."""
    return a * b
```

### Simplicity (over performance/complexity)

Write simple, clear code, even if a more complex solution is faster.
So be aware if you look for help on the internet - the mightiest solution may make it too hard for your teammates to follow in an early stage of getting into programming.

1. Conciseness
2. Avoiding Complexity
3. Code Reusability
4. Refactoring
5. Over-optimization

**Why we need Simplicity?**

- **Readability**: Easier to understand.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updates and changes.
- **Faster Onboarding**: Helps new developers learn quickly.

#### Conciseness

- Concise code means completing the function with the least amount of code and avoiding redundancy.
- Concise code is easier to read and maintain.

`Example`
Summing a List of Numbers.

```python
# bad example
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    return total

# good example: use Python’s built-in `sum()` function
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
```

#### Avoiding Complexity

- Complex code is difficult to understand and maintain.
- Avoiding Complexity can keep code understandable by breaking down complex logic into smaller parts.

`Example`
```python
# bad example: complex logic
def check_number(number):
    if number is None:
        return False
    elif number < 0:
        return False
    else:
        return number % 2 == 0

# good example: simple logic
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
```

#### Code Reusability

- Create reusable functions or modules to avoid code duplication and improve development efficiency.

`Example`

- Consolidate repeated logic into a reusable function.

```python
# bad: duplicate code (not recommended)
def send_email_to_user1():

def send_email_to_user2():

# good: reusable function
def send_email(user):
```

#### Refactoring

- Refactoring is the process of improving existing code without changing its external behaviour.
- Regular refactoring improves code readability and performance, removes duplicate code, and optimises structure.

`Example`

- The `calculate_area_circle` and `calculate_area_square` functions have similar logic for different shapes. Adding new shapes requires creating additional functions, leading to redundant code.

```python
# Before refactoring
def calculate_area_circle(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius ** 2

def calculate_area_square(side):
    return side * side

# After refactoring
def calculate_area(shape, size):
    if shape == "circle":
        return 3.14 * size ** 2
    elif shape == "square":
        return size * size
```

#### Over-Optimization

Write simple, clear code, even if a more complex solution is faster.
So be aware if you look for help on the internet - the mightiest solution may make it too hard for your teammates to follow in an early stage of getting into programming.

```python
# bad: complex one-liner that’s hard to understand
result = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 and x > 2]

# good: simple, readable code even if it’s slightly slower
result = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0 and x > 2:
        result.append(x**2)
```

### Things to avoid when coding

Poor coding practices can lead to buggy, hard-to-maintain, and insecure code. Here are some of the worst coding practices to avoid:

1. **Ignoring Error Handling:** Not handling errors leads to poor user experience and unpredictable behavior. Always implement error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations.
2. **Overusing Comments Instead of Writing Clear Code:** Comments are essential, but they shouldn’t replace clear code. Code should be self-explanatory as much as possible; otherwise, it may indicate that the code itself could be improved.
3. **Writing Code That’s Too Clever:** Clever code (like one-liners or complex conditional logic) might be fun to write but is hard to understand later. Write code that prioritizes readability and maintainability.
4. **Failing to Use Version Control:** Not using version control (e.g., Git) limits your ability to track changes and collaborate effectively. It’s essential for both solo and team development.
5. **Ignoring Code Reviews:** Skipping code reviews or disregarding feedback leads to unchecked mistakes and missed learning opportunities. Code reviews improve quality and provide fresh perspectives on the code.

Avoiding these practices can lead to a codebase that is cleaner, more secure, and easier to maintain, which ultimately makes the development process more efficient and enjoyable.

## Documentation & Comments

### Why Comments and Docstrings are Important in Code

Comments and docstrings are essential in Python because they make code easier to read and understand. They explain **what** the code does and **why** it does it, which is helpful for:

1. **Collaboration**: Other programmers (or even your future self) can quickly understand the purpose and logic of the code.
2. **Maintenance**: When updating code later, comments and docstrings make it easier to modify or debug without having to re-learn how it works.
3. **Learning**: For beginners, comments and docstrings serve as a guide to follow the code’s steps and purpose, making complex code more readable.

In short, comments and docstrings help ensure code is clear, maintainable, and beginner-friendly!

### Docstrings

Docstrings in Python are special comments used to describe what a piece of code (like a function, class, or module) does. They’re a type of documentation placed directly in the code, allowing programmers to quickly understand the purpose of specific code sections without needing to look elsewhere.

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    Greets a person by name.

    Parameters:
    name (str): The name of the person to greet.

    Returns:
    str: A greeting message.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### Comments

#### Lines Comments

Use line comments for brief explanations of specific lines.

```python
x = 5  # Assigns the value 5 to variable x
y = x + 2  # Adds 2 to x and stores the result in y
```

#### Block comments

Use block comments for detailed explanations of code sections, especially if they have complex logic.

```python
# This section calculates the area of a rectangle.
# We need the width and height, then multiply them.
width = 10
height = 5
area = width * height  # Calculates area

```

## Pro-tip: Team-specific coding standards

### Team Coding Standards

1. **Objectives**: Ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability in code.

2. **Style Guide**: Use and customize an existing style guide (e.g., PEP 8).

3. **Formatting Rules**:
   - Indentation: 4 spaces
   - Line Length: Max 79 characters
   - Braces: Follow PEP 8 standards

4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Variables: `snake_case`
   - Functions: Descriptive names (e.g., `move_player()`)
   - Classes: `PascalCase`

5. **Commenting**: Use function comments, inline comments, and docstrings for clarity.

6. **Code Review & Automation**: Implement a review process using GitHub/GitLab and use linters (e.g., pylint) to enforce standards.

  - Using PEP 8 makes code easier to read and follow for all team members, so they can quickly understand each other's work without getting bogged down by inconsistent styles.
- [Virtual environments documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Virtual environments

A Python virtual environment, or "venv," is a tool that creates a separate, isolated environment for each Python project, so you can manage specific packages and dependencies without affecting other projects on your computer.

### WHY?

- **Avoid Conflicts**: Virtual environments keep your project's dependencies separate, so you do not run into issues with different versions of packages across projects.
- **Simplify Collaboration**: When everyone on your team uses a virtual environment, it iss easier to ensure everyone is using the same dependencies and versions, making it easier to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Best Practice for Reusability**: Virtual environments make it easy to package up your project for others to use, and they are a standard practice in professional projects.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure the project you received already contains a ```requirements.txt``` file.

### Workflow on Windows

- **Create a virtual environment**:
  - open a terminal inside [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/terminal-emulator.html) or [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started#:~:text=Open%20the%20terminal%20by%20selecting,the%20Ctrl%2B%60%20keyboard%20shortcut.)
  - ```python -m venv C:\\path\\to\\new\\virtual\\environment```
- **Activate a virtual environment**:
  - If using _cmd.exe_: ```nameOfVenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat```
  - If using _powershell_: ```nameOfVenv\\Scripts\\activate.ps1```
- **Install dependencies (python packages) in your virtual environment**:
  - In your _terminal_ type: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- **Deactivate a virtual environment**:
  - Just type in your _cmd.exe_ or _powershell_: ```deactivate```

### Workflow on Unix-based systems (macOS & Linux)

- **Create a virtual environment**:
  - Open a terminal in your project root directory from [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/terminal-emulator.html) or [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)
  - In your _terminal_ type: ```python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment```
- **Activate a virtual environment**:
  - In your _terminal_ type: ```source nameOfVenv/bin/activate```
- **Install dependencies (python packages) in your virtual environment**:
  - In your _terminal_ type: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- **Deactivate a virtual environment**:
  - In your _terminal_ type: ```deactivate```
